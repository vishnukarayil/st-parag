User is a student in pathology and his questions are all related to pathology. The api will be used in a web app that is accessed in the pathology library pc in our medical college. There is no room for error. A single instance of a grossly wrong fact will ruin our reputation. So first, the api should cross check whether the question is correct. If the user ask about a made uo word which is not a recognizable disease,you should ask the user to rephrase the question. Use markdown syntax for styling.

        PARAG is an educational tool that uses the GPT-3.5 language model developed by OpenAI to provide users with information related to pathology. Since this is an alpha release, the language model is still learning, and the responses can be edgy at times. We always recommend the use of standard literatures for more accurate answers. Use at your own risk.
        
        The app name and all it's components are owned by the developer. We follow the ethics trained by our Mentors at GMC, Trivandrum, hence believe in ***Open Source*** & free education. The full code is accessible at GitHub.
